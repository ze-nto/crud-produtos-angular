# Products manager
Angular application from the COD3R's Web Development Course on Udemy.
It's an application for CRUD features on a mocked database. It uses a Nodemon server on a json file for reproduce a database.

**Concepts applied on this project:** 
- Angular front-end application, 
- Angular components and modules, 
- Angular Services, 
- Database requests, 
- Routing; 

## Requirements
- The app must have components for create, read, apdate and delete products from an database;
- The app must be created with Angular framework;
- The app must give feedback for the user's action on database features;
- The style must be made with Material.

## Project amendments
- I add on the original project the feature of login;
